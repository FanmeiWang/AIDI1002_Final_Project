## Project Overview
This project reproduces the experimental section of the paper *Predicting Employee Turnover: Scoping and Benchmarking the State-of-the-Art*, focusing on the performance of the Logistic Regression (LR) model on the IBM dataset.

## Dataset
- **Name**: IBM Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset contains employee information and attrition status, aimed at analyzing factors that influence employee turnover.

## Experimental Steps
1. Download the code provided by the paper.
2. Configure the experimental parameters (e.g., IBM dataset and Logistic Regression method).
3. Run `main.py` and generate the results.

## Experimental Results
The following results were obtained using the Logistic Regression (LR) model on the IBM dataset:

- **Accuracy**: 0.8388
- **AUC-ROC**: 0.6430
- **AUC-PR**: 0.3546
- **F1-Score**: 0.0000
- **Precision**: 0.0000
- **Recall**: 0.0000
- **Specificity**: 0.0000
- **H-Measure**: 0.0000
- **Brier Score**: 0.1334
